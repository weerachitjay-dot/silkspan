- [x] Create [mockup_compare_fb.html](file:///Users/weerachitbuaim/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cc0a1112-53ea-4ca2-8fcf-25f15b03e8dd/mockup_compare_fb.html) and [mockup_compare_fb.css](file:///Users/weerachitbuaim/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cc0a1112-53ea-4ca2-8fcf-25f15b03e8dd/mockup_compare_fb.css).
- [x] Create [mockup_type1.html](file:///Users/weerachitbuaim/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cc0a1112-53ea-4ca2-8fcf-25f15b03e8dd/mockup_type1.html) and [mockup_type1.css](file:///Users/weerachitbuaim/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cc0a1112-53ea-4ca2-8fcf-25f15b03e8dd/mockup_type1.css).
- [ ] Create `mockup_car_insurance.html`. (User skipped this specific request flow to ask for Article page first? Or wait, let me check the previous turn. actually I should probably do the car_insurance one too if it was pending, but the user explicitly asked for /article/ now. I'll stick to the user's latest request to avoid confusion, or I can do both. The previous request was "Mockup หน้า /car-insurance/". I haven't done it yet. I should probably add it to the list but prioritize /article/ if that's where the user focus is? No, better to clear the backlog if possible, or just focus on the latest. The user "interrupted" with "Mockup หน้า /article/". I will assume priority on /article/ but keep /car-insurance/ in mind or ask. Actually, looking at the previous turn, I *planned* car-insurance but didn't execute. I will prioritize Article Mockup as explicitly requested now, but I'll leave Car Insurance in the backlog).

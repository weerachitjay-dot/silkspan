# Mockup Creation Plan: Compare FB Page

I will create a high-fidelity mockup of the Car Insurance Comparison page based on the user's screenshot.

## Proposed Changes

### [NEW] `mockup_compare_fb.html`
- **Structure**:
    - **Header**: Reused/Adapted from basic Silkspan header.
    - **Stepper**: 3-step progress indicator (Select Plan, Fill Data, Contact).
    - **Success Banner**: Green background "Thank you" message.
    - **Layout Container**: Flex container with Sidebar (Left) and Content (Right).
    - **Sidebar**:
        - Car Info Card (Car model, Year, etc.).
        - Filters (Insurance Tier specific).
        - Insurance Company Checkboxes.
    - **Main Content**:
        - Header: "Result for you X items", View toggles, Sort dropdown.
        - Grid: Cards for insurance packages.
        - Cards: Logo placeholder, Company Name, Class badge, Coverage info (Sum insured, Deductible), Price (Yearly/Monthly), Buttons.

### [NEW] `mockup_compare_fb.css`
- Dedicated styles for the comparison page to ensure exact match with the screenshot without aiming for reusability with the Article page (which has different typography/spacing).
- Will import main [style.css](file:///Users/weerachitbuaim/Documents/TEST_WEB/style.css) for base resets if useful, or just standalone to be self-contained. *Decision: Standalone to avoid deps.*

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Open `mockup_compare_fb.html` in the browser.
- Compare visually with the provided screenshot `uploaded_image_1765461805535.png`.
- Check responsiveness (basic).
